# LuaXInput
(Archive) XInput library for Lua 5.1 &amp; 5.2

I created this library for my own personal use in 2012, and as a chance to practice my skills with the Lua C API. The library is fully-functional, though I never did get the issues satisfactorily sorted-out with the multipe versions of the XInput DLLs available (though I had some thoughts about runtime dynamic loading that I didn't put in the effort for at the time). 

The contents of the repository are the exact contents of the folder as of the time when I backed-up my important files from my desktop PC in 2013. At that point, I had last touched it in 2012, and I don't think I've made any changes to it since then; the HDD with any possible newer version of the files is inaccessible to me at the moment.
